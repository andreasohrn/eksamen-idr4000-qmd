The effect of strength training on performance indicators in distance runners.               J Strength Cond Res               31(1): 9\textendash 23, 2017\textemdash Running economy (RE) and velocity at maximal oxygen uptake (               V               {\.V}               o               2               max) are considered to be the best physiological performance indicators in elite distance runners. In addition to cardiovascular function, RE and               V               {\.V}               o               2               max are partly dictated by neuromuscular factors. One technique to improve neuromuscular function in athletes is through strength training. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a 40-week strength training intervention on strength (maximal and reactive strength),               V               {\.V}               o               2               max, economy, and body composition (body mass, fat, and lean mass) in competitive distance runners. Twenty competitive distance runners were divided into an intervention group (               n               = 11; 29.5 {$\pm$} 10.0 years; 72.8 {$\pm$} 6.6 kg; 1.83 {$\pm$} 0.08 m) and a control group (               n               = 9; 27.4 {$\pm$} 7.2 years; 70.2 {$\pm$} 6.4 kg; 1.77 {$\pm$} 0.04 m). During week 0, 20, and 40, each subject completed 3 assessments: physiology (               V               2 mmol{$\cdot$}L               -1               BLa,               V               2 mmol{$\cdot$}L               -1               BLa [blood lactate],               V               4 mmol{$\cdot$}L               -1               BLa, RE,               V               {\.V}               o               2               max, {\.V}               o               2               max), strength (1 repetition maximum back squat; countermovement jump and 0.3 m drop jump), and body composition (body mass, fat mass, overall lean, and leg lean). The intervention group showed significant improvements in maximal and reactive strength qualities, RE, and               V               {\.V}               o               2               max, at weeks 20 (               p               {$\leq$} 0.05) and 40 (               p               {$\leq$} 0.05). The control group showed no significant changes at either time point. There were no significant changes in body composition variables between or within groups. This study demonstrates that 40 weeks of strength training can significantly improve maximal and reactive strength qualities, RE, and               V               {\.V}               o               2               max, without concomitant hypertrophy, in competitive distance runners.},

  abstract = {Agreement between two methods of clinical measurement can be quantified using the differences between observations made using the two methods on the same subjects. The 95\% limits of agreement, estimated by mean difference 1.96 standard deviation of the differences, provide an interval within which 95\% of differences between measurements by the two methods are expected to lie. We describe how graphical methods can be used to investigate the assumptions of the method and we also give confidence intervals. We extend the basic approach to data where there is a relationship between difference and magnitude, both with a simple logarithmic transformation approach and a new, more general, regression approach. We discuss the importance of the repeatability of each method separately and compare an estimate of this to the limits of agreement. We extend the limits of agreement approach to data with repeated measurements, proposing new estimates for equal numbers of replicates by each method on each subject, for unequal numbers of replicates, and for replicated data collected in pairs, where the underlying value of the quantity being measured is changing. Finally, we describe a nonparametric approach to comparing methods.},

  abstract = {Internal validity refers to the degree of control exerted over potential confounding variables to reduce alternative explanations for the effects of various treatments. In exercise and sports-science research and routine testing, internal validity is commonly achieved by controlling variables such as exercise and warm-up protocols, prior training, nutritional intake before testing, ambient temperature, time of testing, hours of sleep, age, and gender. However, a number of other potential confounding variables often do not receive adequate attention in sports physiology and performance research. These confounding variables include instructions on how to perform the test, volume and frequency of verbal encouragement, knowledge of exercise endpoint, number and gender of observers in the room, influence of music played before and during testing, and the effects of mental fatigue on performance. In this review the authors discuss these variables in relation to common testing environments in exercise and sports science and present some recommendations with the goal of reducing possible threats to internal validity.}

This remains unexplored.                                                           Here, 34 untrained individuals performed contralateral resistance training with moderate and low volume for 12~weeks. Moderate volume led to larger increases in muscle cross-sectional area, strength and type II fibre-type transitions.                                                           These changes coincided with greater activation of signalling pathways controlling muscle growth and greater induction of ribosome synthesis.                                                           Out of 34 participants, thirteen displayed clear benefit of MOD on muscle hypertrophy and sixteen showed clear benefit of MOD on muscle strength gains. This coincided with greater total RNA accumulation in the early phase of the training period, suggesting that ribosomal biogenesis regulates the dose\textendash response relationship between training volume and muscle hypertrophy.                                                           These results demonstrate that there is a dose-dependent relationship between training volume and outcomes. On the individual level, benefits of higher training volume were associated with increased ribosomal biogenesis.                                                                                            Abstract                                Resistance-exercise volume is a determinant of training outcomes. However not all individuals respond in a dose-dependent fashion. In this study, 34 healthy individuals (males                 n                 ~=~16, 23.6 (4.1)~years; females                 n                 ~=~18, 22.0 (1.3)~years) performed moderate- (3 sets per exercise, MOD) and low-volume (1 set, LOW) resistance training in a contralateral fashion for 12~weeks (2\textendash 3 sessions~per week). Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and strength were assessed at Weeks 0 and 12, along with biopsy sampling (m. vastus lateralis). Muscle biopsies were also sampled before and 1~h after the fifth session (Week 2). MOD resulted in larger increases in muscle CSA (5.2 (3.8)\%                 versus                 3.7 (3.7)\%,                 P                 ~{$<~$}0.001) and strength (3.4\textendash 7.7\% difference, all                 P                 ~{$<~$}0.05. This coincided with greater reductions in type IIX fibres from Week~0 to Week~12 (MOD, -4.6 percentage points; LOW -3.2 percentage points), greater phosphorylation of S6-kinase~1 (p85 S6K1                 Thr412                 , 19\%; p70 S6K1                 Thr389                 , 58\%) and ribosomal protein S6                 Ser235/236                 (37\%), greater rested-state total RNA (8.8\%) and greater exercise-induced c-Myc mRNA expression (25\%; Week~2, all                 P                 ~{$<~$}0.05). Thirteen and sixteen participants, respectively, displayed clear benefits in response to MOD on muscle hypertrophy and strength. Benefits were associated with greater accumulation of total RNA at Week~2 in the MOD leg, with every 1\% difference increasing the odds of MOD benefit by 7.0\% (                 P                 ~=~0.005) and 9.8\% (                 P                 ~=~0.002). In conclusion, MOD led to greater functional and biological adaptations than LOW. Associations between dose-dependent total RNA accumulation and increases in muscle mass and strength point to ribosome biogenesis as a determinant of dose-dependent training responses.                                       ,              Key points                                                                For individuals showing suboptimal adaptations to resistance training, manipulation of training volume is a potential measure to facilitate responses.

  abstract = {We have reported that the acute postexercise increases in muscle protein synthesis rates, with differing nutritional support, are predictive of longer-term training-induced muscle hypertrophy. Here, we aimed to test whether the same was true with acute exercise-mediated changes in muscle protein synthesis. Eighteen men (21 {$\pm$} 1 yr, 22.6 {$\pm$} 2.1 kg/m(2); means {$\pm$} SE) had their legs randomly assigned to two of three training conditions that differed in contraction intensity [\% of maximal strength (1 repetition maximum)] or contraction volume (1 or 3 sets of repetitions): 30\%-3, 80\%-1, and 80\%-3. Subjects trained each leg with their assigned regime for a period of 10 wk, 3 times/wk. We made pre- and posttraining measures of strength, muscle volume by magnetic resonance (MR) scans, as well as pre- and posttraining biopsies of the vastus lateralis, and a single postexercise (1 h) biopsy following the first bout of exercise, to measure signaling proteins. Training-induced increases in MR-measured muscle volume were significant (P {$<$} 0.01), with no difference between groups: 30\%-3 = 6.8 {$\pm$} 1.8\%, 80\%-1 = 3.2 {$\pm$} 0.8\%, and 80\%-3= 7.2 {$\pm$} 1.9\%, P = 0.18. Isotonic maximal strength gains were not different between 80\%-1 and 80\%-3, but were greater than 30\%-3 (P = 0.04), whereas training-induced isometric strength gains were significant but not different between conditions (P = 0.92). Biopsies taken 1 h following the initial resistance exercise bout showed increased phosphorylation (P {$<$} 0.05) of p70S6K only in the 80\%-1 and 80\%-3 conditions. There was no correlation between phosphorylation of any signaling protein and hypertrophy. In accordance with our previous acute measurements of muscle protein synthetic rates a lower load lifted to failure resulted in similar hypertrophy as a heavy load lifted to failure.},
